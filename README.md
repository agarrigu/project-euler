# Project Euler Solutions 


My attempt at solving the (first 100) [Project Euler][project-euler link] problems. 

Obviously these are much more fun to figure out on your own. This repository is mainly to learn _more_, aquire new angles of attack. Math Attack.


You should only view the code if you have already attempted to solve the problem or you __know__, **for sure**, you **never** will make the attempt.
